#Week 4 – Power BI Data Modeling & Core DAX Measures

##Objective
Focuses on building a foundation for interactive dashboards by creating clean data models and core business measures by:
- Prepare and clean transactional sales data
- Create a dedicated Date table for time-based analysis
- Build reusable DAX measures for business KPIs
- Ensure model accuracy, consistency, and usability for future reporting

##Dataset: 
Sample Superstore dataset (Kaggle)

##Tool: 
Power BI Desktop
DAX (Data Analysis Expressions)
Power Query Editor
Excel (for initial dataset understanding)

#Data Preparation
- Imported Sample Superstore dataset into Power BI Desktop
- Renamed table to Sales for clarity and readability
- Verified and corrected data types (dates, numeric, text)
- Created derived columns from Order Date:
	Year
	Month Name
	Month Number (used for sorting Month Name chronologically)
- Ensured consistent data structure for future dashboards

#Date Table Creation
- Created a dedicated Date table using DAX:
	Continuous date range covering all transactions
	Attributes: Year, Month Name, Month Number, Year-Month
- Established relationship:
	Date[Date] → Sales[Order Date]
- Marked as the official date table
- Hidden raw date columns in Sales to enforce consistent usage

#Data Model Design
- Fact table: Sales
- Dimension table: Date
- Organized model for easy readability and scalability
- Unused columns hidden; measures grouped under Sales table

#Core DAX Measures
- Measures created in the Sales table to track key performance indicators (KPIs):

Measure				Description
Total Sales			Sum of all sales
Total Profit		Sum of all profit
Total Quantity		Sum of all quantity sold
Profit Margin		Ratio of profit to sales

- Measures are fully filter-responsive and reusable in dashboards.
- Additional Time Intelligence Measure (Optional):
	A Year-over-Year (YoY) Sales measure was created using a dedicated Date table to support time-based analysis and ensure proper model design. This measure is not visualized in Week 4 and is intended for future dashboard enhancements in Week 5.

##Model Validation
- Ensured:
	Correct data types
	Proper relationships between tables
	Measures calculate accurately and respond to filters
	Fields pane is organized, unnecessary columns hidden
	No visual or calculation errors

##Skills
- Skills:
	Data cleaning and transformation (Power Query)
	Data modeling (fact and dimension tables)
	DAX calculations for business KPIs
	Time-based analysis
	Model validation & troubleshooting

##Outcome
- By the end of Week 4:
	A clean, validated data model ready for interactive dashboards
	Core business measures implemented
	A strong foundation for Weeks 5–6 dashboard development and insights
