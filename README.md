# 📊 Data Analysis & Visualization Portfolio

This repository contains my data analysis and data visualization projects as part of my structured transition into an **Aspiring Data Analyst** role.

The portfolio showcases hands-on projects completed using **Excel, Power BI, and SQL,** with a strong focus on **data cleaning, validation, exploratory analysis, dashboard development, and business insight generation.** These projects reflect **real-world analytical workflows** and practical business use cases.

I am currently expanding this portfolio with **SQL projects** to strengthen my ability to **extract, query, and analyze structured datasets** for deeper analytical insights. **Python projects** will be added in the future to further enhance data analysis and visualization skills.
