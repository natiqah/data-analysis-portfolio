# 📊 Data Analysis & Visualization Portfolio

This repository contains my data analysis and data visualization projects as part of my structured transition into an **Aspiring Data Analyst** role.

The portfolio showcases hands-on projects completed using **Excel** and **Power BI**, with a strong focus on **data cleaning, validation, exploratory analysis, dashboard development, and business insight generation.** These projects are designed to reflect real-world analytical workflows and practical business use cases.

I am currently expanding this portfolio with **SQL** and **Python** projects to strengthen my ability to extract, query, and analyze structured datasets for deeper analytical insights.
