# Data Analysis Portfolio

This repository contains my data analysis and data visualization projects
as part of my structured transition into a **Data Analyst** role.

I have completed **Excel-based analysis (Weeks 1–3)** and **Power BI projects
(Weeks 4–6)**, where I developed skills in data cleaning, dashboard creation,
data modeling, DAX calculations, and business insight generation.

I will soon be starting **SQL projects** to strengthen my ability to extract,
query, and analyze structured datasets for deeper analytical insights.

Each project in this portfolio focuses on solving practical business
problems and translating data into clear, actionable decisions.
