#Week 5 – Power BI Interactive Dashboard & Business Analysis

📌 Objective
To analyze sales performance, profitability, and discount impact through dynamic visuals and slicer-driven exploration.

This project focuses on transforming a validated Power BI data model into an interactive business dashboard. The dashboard simulates a real-world business intelligence report used by management to monitor performance and identify improvement opportunities.

🗂️ Dataset: 
Sample Superstore dataset (Kaggle)

- Power Query

🎯 Business Questions Addressed:
1. How is overall sales and profit performance trending over time?
2. Which regions and product categories generate the highest revenue?
3. Which sub-categories are profitable or loss-making?
4. How do discounts affect profitability?
5. Which products contribute most to total profit?
