#Week 6 - Advanced Power BI Business Performance Dashboard

📌 Project Overview
This project presents a multi-page Power BI dashboard analyzing business performance across sales, profit, product categories, discount strategies, and regional contribution.

The goal is to move beyond descriptive reporting and identify key performance drivers, profitability issues, and operational risks using interactive BI features and robust data modeling.

This dashboard simulates an executive-level reporting environment, providing both high-level overviews and drill-down capabilities for granular analysis.

🗂️ Dataset: 
Sample Superstore dataset (Kaggle)

🛠️ Tool: 
- Power BI Desktop
- DAX (Dynamic Title, YearMonthNumber for line chart sorting)

🎯 Business Objectives
1. Analyze overall sales and profitability performance
2. Identify category and sub-category contribution
3. Evaluate the impact of discount strategies on margins
4. Detect recurring loss-generating products
5. Provide executive-level insights for decision-making

📂 Report Structure

Purpose: Identify key revenue drivers and loss contributors

Page 3 - Product Drill-Through Page
Interactive drill-through allowing users to:
- Right-click a Category or Sub-Category
- View detailed product-level performance
- Includes:
	Product Name
	Total Sales

Purpose: Provide contextual insights without navigating away from the main dashboard.

Page 5 - Executive Insights
Text-based summary translating data findings into actionable business insights.

KEY INSIGHTS:
📈 Sales demonstrate consistent year-end seasonality across all years, primarily driven by Technology demand, while early-year performance remains softer.
💻 Technology is the primary revenue and profit contributor, generating the highest sales and margins despite promotional discounts, indicating resilient customer demand.
⚠ Furniture underperforms in profitability despite strong sales volume, with margins significantly impacted by discount strategies.
🌍 The West region leads total sales performance, with Office Supplies contributing the largest share within the region.
📉 The Tables sub-category consistently generates annual losses, suggesting pricing inefficiencies or unfavorable cost structures.

Purpose: Demonstrate analytical reasoning and executive-level communication beyond visualizations.

🗂 Data Modeling Enhancements
The Date dimension table includes:
- Year
- Month Name
- Month Number
- Year-Month
- YearMonthNumber (numeric sorting key)

Why YearMonthNumber?
The YearMonthNumber column was added to ensure proper chronological sorting of the Year-Month field across all Power BI versions. Some newer versions of Power BI do not reliably allow sorting Year-Month by Month Number alone, so this additional column guarantees the Sales Trend line chart displays correctly in any environment.

Example DAX:
YearMonthNumber = YEAR([Date]) * 100 + MONTH([Date])

This ensures:
- Correct time-series visualization
- Consistent line chart pattern
- Compatibility across Power BI versions
- Robust data modeling practice

🛠 Technical Skills Demonstrated
- Data modeling: Custom Date dimension, sorting key creation, relationship management
- DAX measures: KPI calculations, margin analysis, dynamic titles
- Time intelligence: Trend analysis and YoY calculations
- Interactive features: Drill-through, report page tooltips, slicers
- Advanced visualization: Scatter plots, top 10 product rankings, dynamic KPI cards
- Business storytelling: Executive Insights page

🧠 What This Project Demonstrates
- Transition from descriptive reporting to structured analytical storytelling
- Ability to interpret data and provide actionable insights
- Proficiency in interactivity and UX-aware dashboard design
- Strong foundation in data modeling and DAX measures
- This project reflects a progression from Week 5 dashboards to analytical, executive-ready reporting.
